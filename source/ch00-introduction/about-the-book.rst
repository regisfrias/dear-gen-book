About the book
==============

*Dear Gen* is series of generative drawings created by two friends
living in different countries, who mailed each other a new drawing every
Monday, for 20 weeks. The name of our project is a tribute to beautiful
and inspiring project called *Dear Data,* created by artists
`Giorgia Lupi <http://giorgialupi.com>`_ and `Stefanie
Posavec <http://www.stefanieposavec.com/>`_. For the *Dear data* project, Stephanie
and Giorgia, who were also living in separate countries, mailed each other
hand-drawn post cards with data visualizations covering a broad spectrum
of the daily life, from moments of indecision, to laughter and
good-byes. Luckily for us, *Dear data* was later `published as book 
<http://www.dear-data.com/thebook/>`_. We loved *Dear data*, and we though we could 
do the same with creative coding and generative art. 

We decided to run *Dear Gen* as a creative experiment, divided in weekly chapters. We believe that
one week should be enough to keep the project alive and work as a deterrent to our perfectionism. 
We knew from the get going that this would be an open-source project, which we hoped would also 
help to demystify the creative process in generative art. We do not believe that our drawings are 
anyhow superior in technique or aesthetic value, but we hope that the discussion and explanations 
added to each subject would help readers to explore more creative paths and create drawings of their own.
