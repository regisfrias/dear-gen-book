Source code
===========

*Dear Gen* is proudly an open source project. All images in the book can be regenerated
by running the Processing sketch for that chapter, which you can download from Github.

You are invited to experiment, tweak, fiddle and have fun with our code as much as you can!
In a few of the chapters you might find also additional sketches, which generated intermediate images, or variations on the final drawing chosen by the authors.

All **Helsinki** drawings are created by `RÃ©gis Frias <about-the-authors.html#regis-frias>`_.
The source code for each of his cards can be found at
`github.com/regisfrias/dear-gen <https://github.com/regisfrias/dear-gen>`__.

All **Stockholm** drawings are created by `Half Scheidl <about-the-authors.html#half-scheidl-aka-haschdl>`_, and you can find the source code at
`github.com/haschdl/dear-gen/ <http://github.com/haschdl/dear-gen-code/>`_.
