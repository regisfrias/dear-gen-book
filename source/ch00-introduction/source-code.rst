Source code
===========

*Dear Gen* is proudly an open source project. All images in the book can be regenerated
by running the Processing sketch for that chapter, which you can download from Github.

You are invited to experiment, tweak, fiddle and have fun with our code as much as you can!
In a few of the chapters you might find also additional sketches, which generated intermediate images, or variations on the final drawing chosen by the authors.

The source code for all drawings can be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/haschdl/dear-gen-code.

All **Helsinki** drawings are created by `RÃ©gis Frias <about-the-authors.html#regis-frias>`_. All **Stockholm** 
drawings are created by `H. Scheidl <about-the-authors.html#h-scheidl>`_.
