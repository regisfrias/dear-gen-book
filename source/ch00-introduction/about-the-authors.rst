Régis Frias

My first steps in generative art were with music. I studied `electroacoustic composition <https://soundcloud.com/regisfrias/siderurgia>`_ and was soon drewn to the creative possibilities of computer code. Later I studied graphic design and discovered Processing, which was very suitable for my little visual experiments. After I came to Finland, to study New Media at Aalto Universtity I started focusing more on learning programming, mostly to work with front end development, but also to be able to use code expressively. Today I spend part of my time doing front end design and development and a smaller part doing generative art. Music is still one of the most important things in my life.

I started my generative art journey around 2010, when I met Régis and André Vicentini, two Brazilians studying in a masters degree program in New Media at Aalto Universtity. My education and professional experience are centered in technology, in particular data and analytics, and being artistic has never been an aspiration nor a talent. The interests in combining art and technology developed very fast as I talked to André and Régis about the technologies they used in their artistic projects, and was given the privilege of collaborating with them in a few occasions.
On being or not being an artist, I would like to quote Oliver Burkman (?) when talking about aspiring writers: if the job of a writer is to write, then perhaps all you need to become one is start doing regularly.
