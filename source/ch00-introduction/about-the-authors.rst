I started my generative art journey around 2010, when I met Régis and André Vicentini, two Brazilians studying in a masters degree program in New Media at the University of Helsinki. My education and professional experience are centered in technology, in particular data and analytics, and being artistic has never been an aspiration nor a talent. The interests in combining art and technology developed very fast as I talked to André and Régis about the technologies they used in their artistic projects, and was given the privilege of collaborating with them in a few occasions. 
On being or not being an artist, I would like to quote Oliver Burkman (?) when talking about aspiring writers: if the job of a writer is to write, then perhaps all you need to become one is start doing regularly.
