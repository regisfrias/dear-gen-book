How the book is organized
=========================

Each chapter is the result of a one week project around a subject.They are not meant to be read in order as each project is self-contained. The order in which they appear in this book is merely that of the weeks in which each postcard was sent.

In the first page of each chapter you see the author's final compositions for that week, under headings **Stockholm** and **Helsinki**. By navigating to Stockholm or Helsinki, you will find a detailed description of the creative process and techniques used by the authors on that drawing, including comments of the most important parts of the algorithm.

If you are just curious about the source code, a minimal knowledge in programming is helpful, in particular Java. If you intend on running the code examples, you must have the Processing tool installed, so that you can run the .pde files.
