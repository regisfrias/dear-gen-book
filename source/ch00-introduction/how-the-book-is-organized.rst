How the book is organized
=========================

Each chapter describes the project of a given week. They are not meant to be read in order as each project is self-contained. The order in which they appear in this book is mearly that of the weeks in which each postcard was sent.

In the first page of each chapter you see the author's final compositions for that week, under headings **Stockholm** and **Helsinki**. By navigating to Stockholm or Helsinki, you will find a detailed description of the creative process and techniques used by the authors on that drawing.
