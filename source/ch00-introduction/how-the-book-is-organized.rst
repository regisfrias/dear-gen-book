How the book is organized
=========================

Each chapter is the result of a one week project around a given theme. 
RÃ©gis and Half took turns picking the theme of the week, with no 
background or accompanying description of what the theme was about 
- it was simply a word dropped to each other at the beginning of the 
week. We agreed not to impose rules on how to develop the theme or
which techniques to use, as long as it was sent as postcard print.

Because of that, the chapters are not meant to be read in the order 
they are presented. Each is a self-contained project, which you can 
reproduced individually and independently from each other. The order 
in which they appear in this book is merely that of the weeks in 
which each postcard was sent.

The compositions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first page of each chapter you see the author's final compositions for that week, 
under headings **Stockholm** and **Helsinki**. By navigating to Stockholm or Helsinki, 
you will find a detailed description of the creative process and techniques used by the 
authors on that drawing, including comments of the most important parts of the algorithm.

If you are just curious about the source code, a minimal knowledge in programming is 
helpful, in particular Java. If you intend on running the code examples, you must have 
the Processing tool installed, so that you can run the .pde files.
