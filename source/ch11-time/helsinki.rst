Time makes me think of music (which probably raised the idea for the following chapter); music makes me think of a score. For some reason the first thing that came to my mind within this subject was Iannis Xenakis's notation of orchestral glissandi:

He also realised these forms visually in his work as an architect :cite:`xenakis_philips_pavilion`.

I decided to explore this theme and create an algorithmic representation of those glissandi.
