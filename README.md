**This is still a work in progress! Check back soon ;)**

*Dear Gen* is series of generative drawings created by two friends
living in different countries, who mailed each other a new drawing every
Monday, for 20 weeks. The name of our project is a tribute to beautiful
and inspiring project called *Dear Data,* created by artists
`Giorgia Lupi`<http://giorgialupi.com/> and `Stefanie
Posavec`<http://www.stefanieposavec.com/>. In *Dear data,* Stephanie and
Giorgia were also living in separate countries, and mailed each
hand-drawn post cards with data visualizations covering a broad spectrum
of the daily life, from moments of indecision, to laughter and
good-byes.

The authors of Dear Gen share with Giorgia and Stephanie a strong
interest in data, but fare better in the realm of code and mathematics.
