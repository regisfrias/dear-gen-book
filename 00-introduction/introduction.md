# Introduction

_by_ [_Half Scheidl_](https://github.com/haschdl) _and_ [_RÃ©gis Frias_](http://regisfrias.com/)

_Dear Gen_ is series of generative drawings created by two friends living in different countries, who mailed each other a new drawing every Monday, for 20 weeks. The name of our project is a tribute to beautiful ans inspiring project called _Dear Data,_ created by artists \[Giorgia Lupi\]\([http://giorgialupi.com/](http://giorgialupi.com/)\) and  ****[Stefanie Posavec](http://www.stefanieposavec.com/). In _Dear data,_ Stephanie and Giorgia were also living in separate countries, and mailed each hand-drawn post cards with data visualizations covering a broad spectrum of the daily life, from moments of indecision, to laughter and good-byes.

The authors of Dear Gen share with Giorgia and Stephanie a strong interest in data, but fare better in the realm of code and mathematics.
